### Classify Electrocardiograms

Temporal data can have different applications. Here, you will classify which category a sequence of data belongs to. More specifically, you are given sequences that corresponds to electrocardiograms, a.k.a. heart beats.

The dataset contains 5 types of heart beats, some of them corresponding to heart dysfunctions that you will try to predict.

## A Note on Google Colab

For this challenge, you don't need to use Google Colab. There will be **no performance gains** from using it, as today's machines are powerful enough to tackle this challenge — especially if you're on a MacBook with an M1 or newer chip! 😉

Proceed with the challenge as you normally would with Jupyter Notebook (❌ Do not use Colab ❌)

Good luck! 🚀
